# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Native Textbook Specification

## Project Overview
Create a complete AI-native textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using Docusaurus, structured for RAG ingestion and personalized learning experiences.

## Objectives
- Complete Docusaurus book structure (sidebar, routing, frontmatter)
- Module-wise chapter outlines aligned with course weeks
- AI-ready content chunks optimized for RAG ingestion
- Consistent writing templates for chapters, modules, and capstone
- Validation checklist for technical accuracy and completeness

## Core Modules
1. Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
2. Foundations: ROS 2, Simulation, and Control Systems
3. Perception, Navigation, and Manipulation Systems
4. Integration: From Simulation to Real-World Applications
5. Capstone Project: End-to-end Humanoid Robot System

## Technical Requirements
- Writing framework: Docusaurus (Markdown)
- Content creation: Subagents + MCP servers
- Approach: Research-concurrent writing
- Organization: Architecture → Foundations → Systems → Integration → Capstone
- AI-readiness: Optimized for RAG ingestion with clean chunk boundaries

## Content Structure
- Weekly breakdown chapters
- Hardware & deployment appendix
- Architecture diagrams and system narratives
- Explicit simulation vs real-world constraints

## Success Criteria
- Complete, readable, deployable AI-native textbook
- Ready for RAG chatbot integration
- Ready for personalization layers
- Ready for hackathon evaluation
